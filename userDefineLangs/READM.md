# userDefinedLang-markdown.default.modern.xml
Is the **Markdown** definition file from Notepad++. I've adapted it to use the Solarized color palette.
It matches my `Solarized-light-blackened` theme, but should be ok with any light theme.

# userDefinedLang-logfile.xml
Provides highlighting in **log** files, using the Solarized color palette.
It matches my `Solarized-light-blackened` theme, but should be ok with any light theme.

#How to use custom theme files?
- These files need to be copied to the themes folder in your Nptepad++ config folder (`%AppData%\Notepad++\userDefineLangs` for default installations)
- (Re)start Notepad++ after copying the files and they should appear in `Languages`
