## markdown.userDefined.udl.xml
Is the **Markdown** definition file from Notepad++. I've adapted it to use the Solarized color palette.

## logfile.userDefined.udl.xml
Provides highlighting in **log** files, using the Solarized color palette.
It matches my `Solarized-light-blackened` theme, but should be ok with any light theme.
