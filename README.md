# Customizations for [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

## Themes
You'll find some theme files for Notepad++ in the `themes` sub folder. 
They are built upon the `stylers.model.xml` included in Notepad++ 7.8.9 
(and therefore support all languages defined in this version) 
and are based on the [Solarized color palette](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).

## User defined languages
You'll find some UDL files for Notepad++ in the `UserDefineLangs` sub folder.
