# What's the difference to the included themes
The themes are built on `stylers.model.xml` included in Notepad++ releases. Since the themes coming with the Notepad++ installer are updated rarely, my themes provide syntax highlighting for more languages and syntactic structures.

# How to use custom theme files?
- These files need to be copied to the themes folder in your Notepad++ config folder (`%AppData%\Notepad++\themes` for default installations)
- (Re)start Notepad++ after copying the files and they should appear in `Settings -> Styles...`

## Solarized-reborn and Solarized-light-reborn
Because the Notepad++ distribution already contains a `Solarized` and a `Solarized-light` theme, 
these are named `Solarized-reborn` and `Solarized-light-reborn`.
The main difference is, that these support more languages for syntax highlighting. 
Have a look at the [Solarized color palette](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) to get an impression.

## Solarized-light-blackened
`Solarized-light-blackened` uses a black foreground color for default text. 
I'm using this one for better readability, but it's not sticking strictly to the official Solarized palette.
